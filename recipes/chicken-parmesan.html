  <img src="chicken-parm.jpg" alt="Image of Chicken Parmesan">
  <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this
    delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
  <h3>Top tips for making Chicken Parmesan</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Pound chicken to an even thickness</li>
    <li>Don't skimp on seasoning</li>
    <li>Add parmesan</li>
    <li>Rest before cooking</li>
    <li>Go easy on the sauce</li>
    <li>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to tast</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 230C.</li>
    <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavey plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level
      surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2 inch.</li>
    <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts,
      evenly coating both sides</li>
    <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in separate bowl, set
      aside. Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing
      crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the
      hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast
      with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top
      and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspon olive oil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the
      center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 74C</li>
